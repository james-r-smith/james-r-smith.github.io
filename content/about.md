# Summary

I am a geeky composer and musician who supports minimalist and waste-free idealisms. Following with the minimalist idealisms, my music tends to focus on the harmonic movement of the piece. I have been a part of the Classical Guitar Ensemble at the University of Central Florida, playing at a variety of museums and parties. I have also become quite fluent in Java, C, and Go.

Homeschooled and starting college at the age of seventeen, I have pursued my passions in Photography, Music, American Sign Language, and Computer Science before completing my BA in Music with a Minor in Computer Science in May 2016. I pursued these topics with little knowledge beforehand. But with a strong desire to learn, I finished at the top of each class that I took.

Based in Bentonville, Arkansas, I am a programmer for Walmart, where I am expanding my skills every day and using them to benefit the company. On my own time, I have developed and released my first application, [Healthy Eyes](https://github.com/james-r-smith/healthy-eyes), as well as my first watchface, [Casio CA-53W](https://github.com/james-r-smith/casio-ca-53w), for the Pebble Watch.
