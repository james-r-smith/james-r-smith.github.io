Following with the minimalist idealisms, my music tends to focus on the harmonic movement of the piece. I have been a part of the Classical Guitar Ensemble at the University of Central Florida, playing at a variety of museums and parties. I have also become quite fluent in Java, C, and Go.
Homeschooled and starting college at the age of seventeen, I have pursued my passions in Photography, Music, American Sign Language, and Computer Science before completing my BA in Music with a Minor in Computer Science in May 2016.</description></item></channel></rss>
